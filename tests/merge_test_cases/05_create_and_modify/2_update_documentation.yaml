  We should enhance our documentation standards to be more comprehensive.
  I've updated several modules to include:
  - More detailed module-level documentation
  - Examples in docstrings
  - Better type annotations

  +This module provides utilities for validating, transforming, and processing
  +structured data according to defined schemas.

  +Example:

  We need to ensure all our components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
  Here's what I've updated in the button component:
  1. Added proper aria-labels
  2. Made sure it works with screen readers

  File: src/components/Button.tsx
  Line: 12

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
    export function Button({ children, variant = 'primary' }) {
      return (
        <button
  +       aria-label={typeof children === 'string' ? children : undefined}
  +       role="button"
        >
          {children}
        </button>
      );
    }
  ```

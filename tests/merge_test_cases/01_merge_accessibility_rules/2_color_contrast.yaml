  We need to add color contrast requirements to our accessibility standards.
  I've updated the button to ensure proper contrast:
  - Light text on dark backgrounds: 4.5:1 ratio
  - Dark text on light backgrounds: 7:1 ratio

  File: src/components/Button.tsx
  Line: 25

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
    const styles = {
      primary: css`
        background: #1a365d;
  +     /* Ensures 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
  +     color: #ffffff;
      `,
      secondary: css`
        background: #f7fafc;
  +     /* Ensures 7:1 contrast ratio */
  +     color: #1a365d;
      `
    };
  ```

  reason: Color contrast requirements are a critical part of accessibility standards.

  After working with TypeScript for a while, I think we should update our TypeScript guidelines
  to be more comprehensive. I've also noticed our current description doesn't properly reflect
  that we're a dual JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

code_context: |
  File: src/services/AuthService.ts
  Line: 25

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
  - interface LoginResponse {
  -   token: string;
  -   user: any;
  - }
  + type LoginResult = {
  +   token: string;
  +   user: User;
  + } | {
  +   error: string;
  +   code: number;
  + };
  +
  + function login(credentials: Credentials): Promise<LoginResult> {
  +   // Implementation with proper type inference and union types
  +   const response = await api.login(credentials);
  +   return response;
  + }
  ```

expected_generation:
  should_generate: true
  reason: "Updating description to be more comprehensive and replacing TypeScript guidelines"
  operation: "update"
  file_path: ".cursor/rules/code-style.mdc"
  changes:
    - type: "replacement"
      content: "- Avoid using semicolons"
      text_to_replace: "- Use semicolons at the end of statements"
      file_description: "Comprehensive code style and best practices for JavaScript and TypeScript development"

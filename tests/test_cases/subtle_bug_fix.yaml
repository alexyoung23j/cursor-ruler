  Tests handling of a PR comment that looks like it could be a pattern
  but is actually just a specific bug fix. The comment suggests a "pattern"
  but it's really just fixing a specific race condition.

pr_comment: |
  We should check if the connection is closed before trying to reconnect to prevent race conditions

code_context: |
  File: services/database.ts
  Line: 45

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
    async function reconnect() {
  +   if (connection.isClosed()) {
        await createConnection(config)
  +   }
    }
  ```

  Broader file context:
  ```typescript
  class DatabaseService {
    private connection: Connection;
    private config: ConnectionConfig;

    async reconnect() {
      if (connection.isClosed()) {
        await createConnection(config)
      }
    }

    async query(sql: string) {
      if (!connection) {
        await reconnect()
      }
      return connection.query(sql)
    }
  }
  ```

expected_analysis:
  should_create_rule: false
  reason: While the comment suggests a general pattern about connection handling, this is actually fixing a specific race condition in this particular database service rather than establishing a broader pattern.

expected_generation:
  should_generate: false
  reason: This is a specific fix for a race condition in the database service's connection handling, not a general pattern that needs to be enforced across the codebase.

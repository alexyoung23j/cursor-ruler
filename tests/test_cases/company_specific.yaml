  Tests handling of a PR comment about company-specific import patterns.
  This represents a real-world scenario where a company has specific
  rules about importing from their internal packages.

pr_comment: |
  We should import from @acme/core-components instead of @acme/components.
  The /components package is being deprecated in favor of /core-components
  which has better TypeScript support and follows our new design system.

  File: features/dashboard/widgets/MetricsCard.tsx
  Line: 3

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
  - import { Card, CardHeader } from '@acme/components'
  + import { Card, CardHeader } from '@acme/core-components'
  ```

  Broader file context:
  ```typescript
  import React from 'react'
  import { useMetrics } from '../hooks'
  import { Card, CardHeader } from '@acme/core-components'
  import { MetricsChart } from './MetricsChart'

  export const MetricsCard = ({ period }) => {
    const metrics = useMetrics(period)
    return (
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>Metrics for {period}</CardHeader>
        <MetricsChart data={metrics} />
      </Card>
    )
  }
  ```

    # Import Guidelines

    ## Import Structure
    - Use absolute imports for internal packages
    - Group imports by type (react, external, internal)
    - No direct imports from other features

expected_analysis:
  should_create_rule: true
  reason: This comment establishes a clear pattern about package usage that should be consistently applied across the codebase.

expected_generation:
  should_generate: true
  reason: This is a company-specific pattern about package deprecation and migration that should be added to our import rules.

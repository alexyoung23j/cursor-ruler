  Tests handling of a PR comment that reads like architectural guidance
  but is actually just a discussion exploring different approaches.
  The phrasing makes it sound like a rule but it's really just brainstorming.

pr_comment: |
  I think we should consider putting all the validation logic in a separate service layer.
  That way we can reuse it across different controllers and keep the business logic centralized.
  What do you think about this approach? We could also consider using middleware instead.

  Diff hunk:
  ```diff
    async function createUser(req: Request, res: Response) {
  -   if (!req.body.email || !req.body.password) {
  -     return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' })
  -   }
  -   if (!isValidEmail(req.body.email)) {
  -     return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email format' })
  -   }
  +   const validation = validateUserInput(req.body)
  +   if (!validation.isValid) {
  +     return res.status(400).json({ error: validation.error })
  +   }
    }
  ```

  Broader file context:
  ```typescript
  import { Request, Response } from 'express'
  import { validateUserInput } from '../utils/validation'

  export class UserController {
    async createUser(req: Request, res: Response) {
      const validation = validateUserInput(req.body)
      if (!validation.isValid) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: validation.error })
      }
      // ... rest of user creation logic
    }
  }
  ```

expected_analysis:
  should_create_rule: false
  reason: Although the comment discusses architectural patterns, it's phrased as a discussion and exploration of options rather than a definitive pattern to enforce.

expected_generation:
  should_generate: false
  reason: This is an architectural discussion exploring different approaches to validation, not a concrete pattern that should be enforced through a rule.

  Tests handling of a PR comment that introduces accessibility standards.
  This should result in creating a new rule file since accessibility is a distinct
  concern not covered by existing rules.

  We need to ensure all our components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
  Here's what I've updated in the button component:
  1. Added proper aria-labels
  2. Ensured color contrast meets AA standards
  3. Added keyboard focus states
  4. Made sure it works with screen readers

  Let's apply these standards across all interactive components.

expected_generation:
  should_generate: true
  reason: Accessibility standards are a distinct concern that warrant their own dedicated rule file.
